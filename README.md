# Dpcument-Tracking-Tool
A generic document tracking tool based on Access 2016 (core code only, no UI, no proprietary IP)

Collection of VBA classes that I used to centralize a project document tracking system. 

This tool: 
- Is based on a simple database architecture (multiple tables, all related to each other) and the coding is done on VBA
- Supports basic data filtering and visualization (can be easily connected to Power BI if required)
- Contains robust user tracking system implemented for governance and problem solving
- Has multiple frontends were developed depending on user access levels and admin functionality    

## Note: 
The code might be difficult to follow without the accompanying UI. If you are doing something that sounds similar and need help recreating this tool, feel free to reach out!
